## 1 Rules
**COMMUNICATION**
*I'm giving you guys basically free reign over the server, i really don't want to be dealing with your personal problems if it isn't in TOS. The fact that i needed to make this as well is kinda WeirdChamp.*

- Respect the ones that helped getting the server started that day. You waste a lot of time by doing it. This doesn't mean however that you can play the entire evening without anyone else having a good farm round. Not everyone has the time to put into starting the server and just want a good game of BF4.(This comes down to communication again)
- Any conflict can be avoided by simply stating your intensions if you see someone already playing.
- - Try to avoid to farm the server to dead mostly during the night if the server survives the night it's easy early farm for all of you.
- Don't play 24/7 you're not alone.
- **Vehicle peace** or **air peace** won't be tolerated anymore. It is nice to both farm but it can kill a server real quick. If i or other FULL ADMINS see it happening you risk getting kicked.
- Be reasonable, don't let your hatred or lack of skill get the better of you...
