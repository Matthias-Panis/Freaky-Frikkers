# VMware installation guide

#1 System Requirements
Storage:
  - Vanilla (54GB)
  - DLC (100GB)

2 Cores per VM (1 core doesn't run the game)
Check taskmanager to see how many cores you have available (Performance > CPU > Cores: / Threads:)

A bootable ISO (my recommendation is using [ReviOS](https://sites.google.com/view/meetrevision/revios/download?authuser=0) as this saves a bit of storage)

#2 Step by Step guide

1) Install the following: [VMware.exe](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Id4AoZ_dr6G7MfniFkvliKWreTmQSw0f/view?usp=sharing)
2) Run the executable, once it's installed use the following key:

*YZ718-4REEQ-08DHQ-JNYQC-ZQRD0*

3) Now you should have activated your VMware and you can start with making a virtual machine.
4) First screen will give you 2 options, choose for :"Typical recommended"
5) In the 2nd screen you will select the ISO you've downloaded before (ReviOS in my case).
6) Select Windows 10 Pro and press next (or customise your windows i don't see the point of doing it)
7) Press next
8) Depending on the type of server either 54GB or 100GB (can be expanded later). Press next.
9) Customize Hardware, change ram to 3000MB. Close and press Finish
10) Power on the VM, install chrome and origin.
11) After you downloaded BF4 make sure to go to, VM > Install VMware Tools. Let it install after which you can launch the game.
12) As last download [AHK](https://www.autohotkey.com/) and the [BF4seed.ahk](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UjLOmqj43o-6f6VmlXrB5-SQQ6xi0Bkg/view?usp=sharing) this will make sure you won't get kicked after idle time.
13) Well done you've properly setup VM's

As last DM Matti if you don't have throwaway accounts (i might need to invest in more accounts if we get people installing VMware)
