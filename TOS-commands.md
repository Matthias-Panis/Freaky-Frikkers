## 1 FULL ADMINS
## 1-1 Rules
- When using the ticket and map commands make sure to:
  - Tell other admins that you want to play a max ticket rounds
  - Not farm the server to death
  - Let others farm as well

- Be responsible with banning people. Idgaf about kicks, if people are annoying start with tban after that you could ban. Unless obvious cheaters they can get permd instantly. I'll mention adkats commands later.

- Try to avoid to farm the server to dead mostly during the night if the server survives the night it's easy early farm for all of you.
- Don't play 24/7 you're not alone.
- **Vehicle peace** or **air peace** won't be tolerated anymore. It is nice to both farm but it can kill a server real quick. If i or other FULL ADMINS see it happening you risk getting kicked.
- Be reasonable, don't let your hatred or lack of skill get the better of you...


## 1-2 Must read

- When using ticket commands do it between rounds not during a rounds
- Ticket count changes automatically to normal on round END
- Changing to a map needs to be done to maps that are currently in the maplist, if they are not the command won't work.

- Votemap will be enabled on every round start

## 1-5 ACP

*This is only for FULL ADMINS, budget bois sorry but i won't activate your accounts.*

There is the possibility to acces the admin control panel of adkats: [ACP](http://acp.mattiboss.8s.nl/)

To register an account: [Register](https://acp.mattiboss.8s.nl/register)

Once you have done that DM Matti#9999 so he can activate your account with the right permissions. Don't wait for an email to arrive since that function is broken.

## 1-6 Locker

As full admin you won't be affected by any weapon rule apposed to the weapon enforcer.
- Don't abuse this, people will start to cry real fast if you run shotguns
- For minor things like M320 FB etc you can get away with just be careful and read chat with it.
- I do forbid using shotguns if there's another admin in the opposite team.
- Balancing is hard since there are 2 factors tickets / Flags
  - Try to avoid a full base rape *regardless of the amount of tickets*
  - Don't all switch to one team as this inbalances things in the other way.
  - Be smart about balancing, i get that it's not easy but everyone knows how good an individual is.
